# DIU Canteen Hub - University Food Management System

## Overview

DIU Canteen Hub is a comprehensive university canteen food management system built as a full-stack web application. The system connects students with all DIU canteens, allows them to discover menu items, read reviews, and make informed food choices for healthier campus dining. The application features a modern React frontend with a Node.js/Express backend, PostgreSQL database, and implements Replit's authentication system.

```

## System Architecture

The application follows a monorepo structure with clear separation between client and server code:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth with OpenID Connect
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component-based React application** using TypeScript for type safety
- **Modern UI components** from shadcn/ui built on Radix UI primitives
- **Responsive design** with Tailwind CSS and custom gradient themes
- **Client-side routing** with Wouter for navigation between pages
- **State management** using TanStack Query for server state and React hooks for local state
- **Form handling** with React Hook Form and Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Express.js REST API** with TypeScript support
- **Modular route handling** with centralized error handling
- **Authentication middleware** using Replit Auth and Passport.js
- **Session management** with PostgreSQL session store
- **Database abstraction** through a storage interface pattern

### Database Design
- **User management** with mandatory tables for Replit Auth (users, sessions)
- **Canteen system** with locations, operating hours, and ratings
- **Menu management** with items, pricing, and availability
- **Review system** with user ratings and comments
- **Favorites functionality** for personalized user experience

### Authentication System
- **Replit Auth integration** with OpenID Connect
- **Secure session management** using PostgreSQL-backed sessions
- **Protected routes** with authentication middleware
- **User profile management** with automatic user creation/updates

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Users authenticate through Replit's OAuth system
2. **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query manages API calls with caching and error handling
3. **Real-time Updates**: Application refetches data on user interactions
4. **Search Functionality**: Backend provides search across canteens and menu items
5. **Review System**: Users can create and view reviews for menu items
6. **Favorites Management**: Users can save and manage favorite items

## External Dependencies

### Core Framework Dependencies
- **React ecosystem**: React 18+ with hooks, Vite for development/building
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL driver (@neondatabase/serverless)
- **UI Components**: Complete shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth with Passport.js and OpenID Client
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with PostCSS and Autoprefixer

### Development Tools
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across frontend and backend
- **ESBuild**: Fast bundling for production builds
- **Vite plugins**: Development enhancements including error overlay and debugging tools

### Database Hosting
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting
- **Connection pooling**: Built-in connection management
- **Migration system**: Drizzle Kit for database schema management

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Replit integration**: Optimized for Replit development environment
- **Hot reloading**: Vite dev server with HMR support
- **Development logging**: Comprehensive request/response logging
- **Error handling**: Runtime error overlay for development debugging

### Production Deployment
- **Build process**: Vite builds frontend assets, ESBuild bundles server code
- **Static asset serving**: Express serves built frontend from /dist/public
- **Environment configuration**: Database URL and session secrets via environment variables
- **Session persistence**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions for scalability

### Database Management
- **Schema migrations**: Drizzle Kit handles database schema changes
- **Connection management**: Serverless-friendly connection handling
- **Data validation**: Zod schemas ensure data integrity across the application

The architecture emphasizes modern web development practices with strong typing, component reusability, and scalable backend patterns. The system is designed to handle a university-scale user base while maintaining good performance and user experience.
